My team and the larger organization can clearly articulate the goals of the consulting team.
Our customers and our team would agree on our value proposition.
Our team's goals support the goals of the larger organization and are aligned with those of other departments (e.g. Sales, Marketing, Product Management).
Services, Sales, and Marketing have defined a Go To Market strategy with measurable objectives.
Market positioning and branding reflect the Services team's core purpose and value proposition.
The Services Portfolio contains a discrete set of service offerings defined and approved by Services leadership.
Sales consistently sells services in accord with our established process.
Any deviation from the established sales process, or selling of services outside the services portfolio, is properly communicated to Services management.
We use a well-defined, well-executed New Hire Onboarding (NHO) program.
We measure the effectiveness of our NHO program.
The Key Performance Indicators (metrics) are reviewed regularly by Services management, Finance, and senior leadership and are strongly aligned with the goals and objectives of the Services team.
Team members are empowered to make decisions but reach out to management for approval when required.
